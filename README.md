View the final Google slide project presentation here. Note: This presentation was created as a group with classmates. However, all other documentation for Red Team, Blue Team and Network Analysis was my own personal work. We were only assigned to be a team to bring our findings together to create a group presentation and present together on the final day of our Cybersecurity Bootcamp.
